This is part of my personal grimoire. 

To wit:

- Stuff will often be broken. Unless
I've posted a note directly asking for 
help, I want to keep working on things
myself to solve them. 

Don't open issues in that case. 


- If you see an issue with something
I've fully written up (i.e. it has
a README.neo file with it that has
a ``-- status`` of either ``done``
or ``published``), feel free to
open an issue to discuss. 


- Don't do any PRs without opening
an issue and discussing it with me
first. 


- It may be a long time before I respond 
to an issue. It may also be never.  


- I'm not interested in AI generated code.

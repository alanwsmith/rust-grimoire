Making a Rust Macro Test Runner

-- notes

- I've got a custom format set to rust tests
that let's me send data in different ways
and get expected success and failure responses. 

- Each test is in its own file. I'd been
running them with ``rstest`` and a few other
methods. The problem is they would all have
errors like ``case 32 failed``. I'd have to
figure out which file was 32. 

- Sure, I could have named the files with 
the numbers. That's always a pain. 

- Wrote this macro that takes a directory,
reads the files in it, splits them into
their parts, and sends them to the test
harness. 

- Probably there's already a crate that
does this. I didn't look hard beyond
rstest and test_case.

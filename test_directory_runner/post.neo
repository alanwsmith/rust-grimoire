Run Tests from a Directory in Rust


-- checklist 

[x] Scan a directory for a list of
other directories. 

[x] Use those directories as the payloads
for running tests.

[x] Use the directory names in the 
test outpust so you can see what failed.

[x] Automatically rerun tests when the 
files in the directories change.


-- notes

- Uses a ``test_runner`` function for the example. 
The idea is you can use that as a helper
function and then just throw directories
at it for processing from different
source files.

# rust-grimoire

A place for me to work on and
collect snippets of Rust code. 

## Process

- Start `./_run_grimiore_experiments/script.rs`
to auto run files when they change. 

- Make a new experiment by making a new folder 
at the root of this project with a
good name for it. Put a <<path|script.rs>> 
file in it that is the default location
for scripts. 

- Add metadata to the script that
can be picked up by the grimoire 
processor. 


## TODO 

- Consolidate snippets into here

- Figure out how to integrate this
into the overall grimoire search
and publication.

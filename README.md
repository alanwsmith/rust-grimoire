# rust-grimoire

A place for me to work on and
collect snippets of Rust code. 

## Process

- Start `./run_grimiore.bash`
to auto run files when they change. 

- Make a new experiment by making a new folder 
at the root of this project with a
good name for it. Put a <<path|script.rs>> 
file in it that is the default location
for scripts. 

- Add metadata to the script that
can be picked up by the grimoire 
processor. 

## Header Stuff

For inside the front matter

```

[grimoire]
created = "2025-05-21T17:54:09-04:00"
updated = "2025-05-21T17:54:09-04:00"
id = "2x/v3/wp/gu"
status = "scratch"
```


## TODO 

- Consolidate snippets into here

- Figure out how to integrate this
into the overall grimoire search
and publication.

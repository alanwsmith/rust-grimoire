# Alan's Rust Grimoire

A place for me to work on and collect 
snippets of Rust code. 

This is the raw material for problem
solving. It's also the raw material
for [posts on my blog](https://www.alanwsmith.com)

Most things will end up with a write-up
in a `post.neo` file in the individual
directories. That's the content for
the site.

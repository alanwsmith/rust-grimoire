# rust-stuff.alanwsmith.com

A place for me to work on and
collect snippets of Rust code. 

## Process

- Start `./scripts/watcher/watch.bash`
to auto run files when they change. 

- Make new experiments in the 
`experiments` folder. 

- Each experiment gets its own folder
with the main code in a file called
`script.rs`


## TODO 

- Consolidate snippets into here

- Figure out how to integrate this
into the grimoire.
